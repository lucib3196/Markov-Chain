# What is A Markov Chain 
Markov Chains are used to model the change in population from one state to another

**Applications of Markov Chains include:**
- What Brand of soda to customers prefer Coke Pepsi or another brand
- The amount of airplanes at a given terminal 
- Voting Demographics 

# Markov Chain Function 
## Function Parameters
- **Transition_Probability**: A list in the form of decimals will be used to form the matrix of transtion probability
- **Initial Population**: A list containing the current population 
- **Years**: The amount of time passed

The function can only deal with three populations nothing more nothing less

## Future Updates
The Function still has alot of work to be done. The following is just a list of things I want to add
- Steady State Matrix 
- Absorbing Markov Chains 
- Add parameters to choose how many populations
- Add parameters to prevent code from blowing up

## Update Log 
## Ver 1.2 
Added Steady State Matrix 
## 3/7/2022
Jupyter Notebook File Unchanged 
Added Markov Chain Class still in the work, needs to add steady state matrix to the class.
